# Step 1: Define Ribbon EMS WSDL URL
WSDL_URL = "http://your-ribbon-ems-url/service?wsdl"

# Step 2: Setup Authentication (if needed)
session = Session()
session.auth = HTTPBasicAuth('your_username', 'your_password')

# Step 3: Initialize the SOAP Client with Authentication
client = Client(WSDL_URL, transport=Transport(session=session))

# Step 4: List Available Operations (optional, helps debugging)
print(client.service)

# Step 5: Call a SOAP Method (Example: Get Network Elements)
try:
    response = client.service.GetNetworkElements()
    print("Response:", response)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
